# Deep Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my repository for deep learning projects! This repository showcases my work in the field of deep learning, with a focus on biomedical data analysis. Here, you will find a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise and proficiency in applying deep learning techniques to solve complex problems in the biomedical domain.

## About the Projects

### Project 1: Exploring Xception and MobileNetV2 Models for Biomedical Data Analysis: A Comparative Study

In this project, I have conducted a comparative study on the performance of Xception and MobileNetV2 models for the analysis of biomedical data. Specifically, I have utilized these models to tackle the challenging task of COVID-19 diagnosis. By leveraging deep learning techniques, I have explored the capabilities and effectiveness of these models in accurately classifying COVID-19 cases. The project includes detailed analysis, visualizations, and evaluation metrics to demonstrate the comparative performance of the models.

### Project 2: Comparison of activation function methods. Evaluation based on Data 1.

Learning models have been developed on different data sets based on activation functions. The biggest difference here is in the data. Some modifications were made to the model to recognize the data.

To access the project, please switch to the `data1_project` branch.
